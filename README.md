#### NCHRP 667

- This report and enclosed CD-ROM presents course materials, including the instructor's guide and student workbook, for a fundamental highway safety training course. The course presents the core competencies all highway safety practitioners should have or acquire. The CD also includes a brochure and short Microsoft Power Point presentation for marketing the training course. The report will be of particular interest to personnel responsible for professional staff development and managing safety programs.

#### Highway Safety Fundamental Course

- This project developed a teaching package for safety fundamentals for undergraduate
students and graduate students in civil engineering. The course covers seven topics:
introduction to highway safety, basic safety concepts, safety related data, fundamental
statistics, development of safety models, safety predictive models in HSM, and safety
evaluation. Accordingly, seven lecture notes were developed along with homework
assignments, quizzes, and exams.

### Basic

- [CS 635](https://web.engr.uky.edu/~rsouley/CE635-2019/) **Higway Safety Engineering** *University of Kentucky* :computer: :book: :wrench: :books: 
	- This course focuses on developing an understanding of the various aspects of transportation safety by seeking answers to general questions and issues and exploring the methods used to quantify safety. Safety issues regarding all modes of transportation are also discussed.

### Mid-Level

- [CVEN 626](https://ceprofs.civil.tamu.edu/dlord/CVEN_626_Course_Material.htm) **Higway Safety** *Texas A&M University* :book: :wrench: :books: 
	- Fundamental concepts for performing traffic safety analyses; crash data collection and database management; safety improvement programs; accident data analysis; development of statistical models; before-after studies; economic analyses; accident risk.

### Advanced

- [TTE 6307](https://bit.ly/327Xa0i) **Statistical and Econometric Methods** *University of South Florida* :book: :wrench: :books: 
	- The objective of this course is to provide students with a general background in the application of various statistical and econometric analysis techniques. The course will present a number of model-estimation methods that are used in the analysis of engineering and scientific data. It is important to note that the methods presented can be used in a wide variety of data-analysis applications and go well beyond the techniques typically covered in statistics courses. The course will emphasize model estimation and application, but underlying theory and limitations will be discussed to ensure that the methods are properly applied and understood.

- [TTE 6501](https://bit.ly/2Pmsuad) **Statistical and Econometric Methods II** *University of South Florida* :book: :wrench: :books: 
	- The objective of this course is to solidify students' understanding of the material taught in CGN 6933.010 (Statistical and Econometric Methods) and to extend students' knowledge with the presentation of new model estimation techniques not covered in CGN 6933.010. Specifically, we will undertake detailed assessment of simultaneous equations models (seemingly unrelated regressions and three-stage least squares), generalized extreme value models (nested logit models estimated by full information maximum likelihood), mixed logit models (to account for variations in parameters across the sample population), latent-class models, models with fixed and random effects, zero-inflated count data models, and multivariate models.
